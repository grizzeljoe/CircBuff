Problem Statement
 
Write a program to show linear buffer implementation of a circular buffer.
 
Test Method:
 
File Copy function:
Copy a file using the circular buffer implementation.
 
Flow of the copy function:
 
Assuming N to be the buffer size
 
1) Read bytes from the file
2) Write the bytes to the buffer
3) Read bytes from the buffer
4) Write bytes to the new file
 
Condition:
 
1) n<N
2) The implementation should work for any values for N and n
 
	
main (args of n, N, fileToRead, fileToWrite)

malloc circbuffer N bytes
create and initialize read and write bytepointers to circbuffer;
localvars ints of read and write counter - initialize to zero 
open fileoRead  read only
create a fileToWrite for write access

do
  // Read from the file to the circbuffer
  if current (readcounter + n) <  N
     read n bytes to readBytePointer
     (re)initialize to zero -> readcounter, readBytePointer
  else
     read (N-n) bytes
     increment readcounter, readBytePointer
     read (n mod N) bytes	
     increment readcounter, readBytePointer	

  // Write to the file from the circbuffer
  Similar activity writing the fileToWrite from the circular buffer
  maintaining the writepointers and counters

until (fileToRead is EOF)
 
Close the fileToRead and fileToWrite files 
end
